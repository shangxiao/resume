## Developer Profile

I'm a developer specialising in Python, Django & PostgreSQL.

I'm a member of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/individual-members/) & am currently part of the [Triage & Review Team](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/teams/#triage-review-team).  I love working with open source and giving back to the open source community.

Although I mainly work with Python/Django/Postgres/React but I've always liked to explore new horizons and am not limited to the Django realm.  I'm also currently re-learning functional programming through Haskell with a view to exploring Elm, Reason, Clojure or Scala and also feeding this back into my Python development.

In the web development world I tend to value [simplicity over complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python), [boring over exciting](https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology) and [readability/maintainability over optimised](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth#Computer_Programming_as_an_Art_(1974)). I'm a fan of [YAGNI - You Aren't Gunna Need It (yet)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren't_gonna_need_it) which encourages simple designs to satisfy initial business requirements with a view to enhancing later once necessity has been established. My methods may seem counterintuitive, such as [delaying DRYness](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction), but these approaches have been curated from experience. I also tend to avoid over-commenting code, focusing on the WHY rather than the WHAT and readable, self-documenting code. I find that Python is great for this. Although I find scalable architectures & microservices interesting, the [Monolithic architecture](https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future) with proven frameworks such as Django are my go-to.

I love testing, albeit with a somewhat controversial approach of [preferring integration testing over unit testing](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/write-tests). I find TDD useful but not required. I value coverage but I also recognise that it should be more of a [guide than a goal](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestCoverage.html). Testing strategy depends on the circumstances.

Finally, I rather enjoy teaching people (and learning myself) - especially the things that only come with experience.  I value the roles that pair-programming, impromptu discussions and merge requests have in providing an opportunity to convey these experiences.
